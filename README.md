The audited tables for this project are marked. 
For the rest of the commands that are useful here please see the 

1. DB2 12.1 with DB2 Auditing - CAP systems.md - This is specific to the India Auditing of specif tables for the schema user. 
and
2. DB2 Auditing - Operations.md - This is a role-based auditing of specific users.

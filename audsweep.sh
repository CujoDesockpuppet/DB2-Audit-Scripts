# Usage:
# audsweep.sh SID (the database SID is mandatory)
# It will not care if it's entered in upper or lower case.
# This will converted to upper or lower case as needed.
### Case conversion
##### We use "^^" to convert a variable to upper case as seen below.
##### We use ",," to convert a variable to lower case as seen below.
#### Database SID
#### CUR_SID=${1^^} would take the input value of "cai" and make the
####               value of CUR_SID = "CAI"

# Weekly or daily archive of the audit files.
# This will also attempt to check the filesystems
# involved to determine if the source or destination

#######################BEGIN CONSTANTS ###############
########### Constants:
##### Of course you can modifiy all of them. Call them guesses or assumptions if
##### you wish. You can override them if you like, these drive much of the logic.

### Conversion Factor - Best guess at size of extract files
###                     vs. the size of the audit archives
###       This isn't used here other than a reporting estimate.

EXTRACT_MULTIPLIER_FUDGE_FACTOR=2.3

### No reason to change this unless for testing. Output to determine that db2pd -
### with the db2sid ID returns the default <sid> database as active.
#### Also see the DB2DBDFT envirenment variable.

### Reporting files expiration in days.
